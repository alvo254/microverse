RPC (the “g” stands for something different in every gRPC release) is an interprocess communication technology that allows you to connect, invoke, operate, and debug distributed heterogeneous applications as easily as making a local function call.

When you develop a gRPC application the first thing that you do is define a service interface. The service interface definition contains information on how your service can be consumed by consumers, what methods you allow the consumers to call remotely, what method parameters and message formats to use when invoking those methods, and so on. The language that we specify in the service definition is known as an interface definition language (IDL).

## Service Defination
gRPC uses protocol buffers as the IDL to define the service interface. Protocol buffers are a language-agnostic, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism to serializing struc‐ tured data (we’ll cover some of the fundamentals of protocol buffers in detail in Chapter 4, but for now you can think of it as a data serialization mechanism). The service interface definition is specified in a proto file—an ordinary text file with a .proto extension. You define gRPC services in ordinary protocol buffer format, with RPC method parameters and return types specified as protocol buffer messages. Since the service definition is an extension to the protocol buffer specification, a spe‐ cial gRPC plug-in is used to generate code from your proto file.
